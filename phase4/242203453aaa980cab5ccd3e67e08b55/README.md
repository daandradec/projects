## FRiC - (Fresh Roommates in Chicago)
<i><small>(Secure, natural and freshness)</small></i>

### Description of the datasets and function design:
So far, I have not used the proposed datasets for Ironhacks.<br>
[N] Do you use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov? <br>
[N] [List] Are all these datasets from data.gov or data.indy.gov? If not, where are they coming from (links)? <br>

### Brief Description:
FRiC is an application that will guide those who wish to travel to the city of Chicago and not know about it. The application will have markers of interesting places to visit, restaurants and indicators of danger zones, for the latter will show statistical and historical.<br>

## Fill in the structured description:
### Map View:
[Y] Basic Map with specific location (41.8708° N, 87.6505° W). <br>
[N] Markers for location of markets. <br>
[N] Labels for markets' names. <br>
[N] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market. <br>
[N] [describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect). <br>

### Data Visualization:
[N] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...). <br>
[N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...). <br>

### Interaction Form:
[N] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...). <br>
[N] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...). <br>
[N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...). <br>
[N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...). <br>
[N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...). <br>

## Build Case:
So far, the application uses Bootstrap dependencies, the necessary ones are already inside the css, fonts and js folders. <br>

## Test Case:
Tests were performed on the Chrome and Edge browsers. <br>

## Additional information:
I had some problems with the implementation of the maps of google, this gave to some inconveniences with the generation of the key, but with the help of other companions I was able to solve it. <br>
At the moment I find myself looking for how to use the mandatory data set, and additional ones to use in the application. <br>
