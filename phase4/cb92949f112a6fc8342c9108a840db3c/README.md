Chicago Maps



My application is called Chicago maps and is currently in development. The application will assist students who wish to move to an apartment near the computer science department of the University of illinois. This application will show on the map places near the university, taking into account neighborhood security and budget. Other options may be chosen manually as well for personal preferences, like choosing a place with specific locations nearby, such as parks, Green areas, police stations among other locations.

The keyword for my project are:University of Ilinois,safety,budget,near.
