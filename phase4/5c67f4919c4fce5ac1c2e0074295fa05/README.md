# Welcome come to Ironhacks!

This is the starting point of my app, thinking about the best solution for looking for an accommodation for a student of the university of Illinois. I hope you can find it productive!

## Improvements:

Now you can visualize a new page exclusibily for looking special features of every acomodation. Idealy you can select one specific rent place, and find all especifications in the map ( parks, crime rates, shops, etc...) so, the user will be able to make a better choise .

I hope you've found the app useful!!! Now, you can looking for restaurants (and their names), crime  rates (type of) and parks on the map, and you can select a marker for rent for closer visualization.
