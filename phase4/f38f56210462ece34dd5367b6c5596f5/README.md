## App Implementation

There is filler words in many places inorder to get the right consistency in places.
I intend to make an app where using the CUESA http://www.cuesa.org/eat-seasonally/charts/vegetables website and the data.gov vegetable prices https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/fruit-and-vegetable-prices/ I have created my own dataset in order to make my app.
I am still yet to implement it in due time. I have created little bit of the dataset for a couple vegetables in a [vegetables.csv](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~nabraham/2017-Purdue-IronHack-NTAbraham/dev/vegetables.csv) which you can view. I ve also implemented a php form for the users to know the total cost of their intended produce. There could definitely be another way to implement the dropdown for the number of pounds for the vegetables and also a carousel for the vegetables and their images.

The map with markers can point the user to the market place and the directions when they click on the infowindow.

Ive also created a d3 of the vegetables that are available during the spring and summer months.


Ive also used a bootstrap template that which is available online and Ive tweeked it to give it some of the veggie touch([Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Business Casual](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-casual/))
