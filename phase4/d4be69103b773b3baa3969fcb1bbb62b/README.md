# Welcome to my Mashup!

Okay so, my name is Felipe Moreno.

For this time i modified the appearance of the mashup, added some bootstrap for a grid and fixed some issues that my old css gave.

I also got my google console key and finally got the map, also got my own key for the climate set and added a script that uses it.

The button in the form still doesnt work, and i haven't figured out the best way to switch in place my form so i can add what i want there, or simply remove it

I have included the affordable rent dataset but got a js problem, im still trying to solve it so right now my button is annoying and wont make any process

i have also started to retrieve the information from my form.
