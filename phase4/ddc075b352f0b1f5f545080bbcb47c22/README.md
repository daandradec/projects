Find your house

Basically my application shows information about the weather in chicago and the location of the University of Illinois, Chicago on the map with a tag representing its location.
Does not have any interaction between application and user
The weather is obtained through the API of http://api.openweathermap.org and the map is obtained from the google maps API and places in rent were obtained from the xml version of the following page https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/affordable-rental-housing-developments-ef5c2.
The application with information of this same, also was implemented a template to make the application more comfortable and already shows the places for rent in the city of chicago.
In short versions you want to show all the information of these places with its benefits so that the users are able to find their ideal place to rent.
