Per my landlord, \"the new tenants will need to sign and pass the background check. The cost for a background check is $25\/person. Each person living there will need to pass.Once they have passed this they'll need to agree to and sign the lease. Please note the 1.5 month deposit that they'll need to provide at at the time of signing.\""}}

Many loft conversions, luxury new construction buildings and the new Soldier Field have further broadened the neighborhood's appeal to visitors and prospective residents alike. Bordered by the lake, Cermak to the south and Canal Street to the west, the South Loop includes the historic rowhouses of Printer's Row and the Dearborn Park residential development.\n\nLike the Near South Side, the South Loop is a major player in the city's residential and business plans for the next decade. This neighborhood is seriously up-and-coming.\n\nColumbia College and the School of the Art Institute bring many young artists and students to the South Loop. Chicago's Museum Campus is the cultural anchor of the neighborhood and attracts an abundance of tourists and culture-seekers to see the world famous Field Museum & Shedd Aquarium almost every day of the year.\n\nTransportation in the South Loop is a snap, with access to Metra, the El Blue, Red, Green and Orange Lines, and CTA busses on many major streets. The South Loop also has I-90 on its western edge and I-41 along the lake shore.\"","whatOwnerLoves":"Historic landmark building; unusually large terrace; light and spacious rooms; great neighbors; easy access to restaurants, shopping & museums; central location -- easy to get anywhere from here","neighborhood":"Printer's Row; South Loop","schoolDistrict":"Chicago","elementarySchool":"South Loop Elementary School","highSchool":"(closest) Jones Academic Magnet High School"}}

United by an architecturally inventive staircase, these were once 3 one bedroom units. Because no one will ever walk over your head, you have the beauty of the timber loft with none of the sound issues.The top floor has arched windows with an open kitchen with honed granite counters and tiled backsplash. The timber ceiling and exposed brick give the wide open spaces a warm and elegant feel. A powder room is on this level as well.Everywhere throughout the unit are built-ins that will remain. Floor to ceiling bookshelves create library spaces around the staircase. Built-in cabinetry abounds. The middle floor has two bedrooms, a full bath and a laundry. Both bedrooms have ample closets and built-in shelves.The lowest level is currently being used as the master bedroom suite. It has a dressing room and a Mexican tiled full bath.Sleeping lofts are near the ceiling and there is still the original kitchen on this floor. There is ample opportunity for lots of privacy and lots of coming together in this remarkable space. It has 3 separate PINs and assessments so it can be separated (if ever desired) into 3 units.This wonderful condominium combines the sweeping vistas of loft living with a house-like ambience. It has been updated with 3 separate central air conditioning units. The sellers also have a garage space at the 801 South Plymouth condo garage that they will sell separately.It's an easy walk or roll to Grant Park, the site of all the great Chicago events on the Lakefront, from this marvelous Chicago condo in Printers Row. Summerdance, with free summer dance lessons and live dance bands is just two blocks away. The Art Institute is a few blocks north, the Millennium Park is just a couple of blocks north of that, and the Museum Campus with the Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum is a few blocks south. And of course, State Street (that great street) and all the big department stores like Macys and Sears are just blocks away. South on Roosevelt Road are the big box stores; from Jewel & Whole Foods to Target and Home Depot.You can live in a neighborhood close to everything that makes Chicago exciting. Watching your tax dollars at work, the planters are full of flowers, the streets are cleaned daily and the snow is cleared before you even come down the elevator to the sidewalk.But what makes Printers Row really special is the quiet but lively blocks of Dearborn right at your door. Taverns and restaurants, dry cleaners and salons, this is the quality of life we seek in an urban setting. A real neighborhood in the heart of the city.","neighborhood":"Printer's Row"}}

Summerdance, with free summer dance lessons and live dance bands is just two blocks away. The Art Institute is a few blocks north, the Millennium Park is just a couple of blocks north of that, and the Museum Campus with the Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum is a few blocks south. And of course, State Street (that great street) and all the big department stores like Macys and Sears are just blocks away. South on Roosevelt Road are the big box stores; from Jewel & Whole Foods to Target and Home Depot.You can live in a neighborhood close to everything that makes Chicago exciting. Watching your tax dollars at work, the planters are full of flowers, the streets are cleaned daily and the snow is cleared before you even come down the elevator to the sidewalk.But what makes Printers Row really special is the quiet but lively blocks of Dearborn right at your door. Taverns and restaurants, dry cleaners and salons, this is the quality of life we seek in an urban setting. A real neighborhood in the heart of the city.This breathtaking penthouse condo has three floors of living and wonderful space and light. The kitchen has a Subzero refrigerator and top of the line stainless steel appliances with granite countertops and hardwood cabinets. The master bath has a whirlpool tub and a separate steam shower as well as a double sink vanity and built-in drawers and closets for a dressing area. There is storage tucked into spaces throughout the condo and a large storage space off the top floor terrace. The huge terrace boasts breathtaking views of the Willis Tower and the Loop and colorful sunsets all year around. There are also three separate spaces that could be used for office areas within the condo. The concrete floors below and only the roof above make the penthouse unit incredibly private and quiet. It is above the neighboring buildings, so one has the sense of infinite space outside the windows. Hardwood, marble and cork floors are on the first floor, carpeting on the stairs and 2nd floor, and hardwood floor on the 3rd level master bedroom. That room features a Murphy bed which folds out from the wall so that it can be hidden and that room can be used for even more entertaining space. The first floor bedroom has floor to ceiling built-ins and a media center with a built-in desk. ","whatOwnerLoves":"Exciting space, terrific light and wonderful outdoor space for relaxing and entertaining.","neighborhood":"Printer"}}
