## Best Chicago Options

The first idea I had watching the information and finding the data sets on data.gov, was to take
the points given by the page about places where a crime was made. This way find where were the
safest places and the risky ones. But is not cool to open a page and see crime scenes, so I changed
to first showing the best weather, then the nearest libraries and finally unsafe places.
