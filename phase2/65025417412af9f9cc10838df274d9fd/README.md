Title - FRESH VEGGIES!

Keywords: freshness, distance, price, climate

Description of the datasets and function design

[Farmer's Market] [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-2015]. Distance from Purdue University and the name of the market are the two columns used for this project.
[Y/N] Do you use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov? YES (I have been facing issues while integrating the data set using the token)
[Y/N] [List] Are all these datasets from data.gov or data.indy.gov? If not, where are they coming from (links)? YES
Brief Description
The 'FRESH VEGGIES!' project would allow the user to conveniently and efficiently be able to locate fresh vegetables around his/her locality. 
The data will be distinguished based on the vegetable's freshness, price and distance.  

Fill in the structured description:

[Y/N] Labels for markets' names YES
[Y/N] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market NO
[Y/N] [describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect) YES (have not yet been applied)

[Y/N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...) NO
Interaction Form:

[Y/N] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...) NO
[Y/N] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...) SEARCH BASED ON CONVIENCE OF CLOSENESS OF MARKETS

[Y/N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...) FILTER BASED ON PRICE AND DISTANCE
[Y/N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...) FILTER AND SORT
Build Case How can we build and access your project on a Linux/Unix machine if you use external dependencies besides HTML/CSS/Javascript? List the dependencies you used, such as python, node.js, etc. List the steps we should follow to build the project. PYTHON AND NODE.JS
Download the node.js, install nmp and run the d3 files locally

Test Case Which browsers did you test your project on? Chrome, IE, Edge, Safari, or Firefox? Chrome

Additional information You Want to Share with Us E.g. any problems you faced/fixed, where you reached out to for help, etc.
 I am still working on building the project based on the information mentioned above. One of the majr problems I am facing is reading Climate data set due to the tokens
