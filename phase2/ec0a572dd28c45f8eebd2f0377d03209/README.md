Description of the datasets and function design
  - Following the fifth requirement of users that need to obtain data on topics such as weather, distance to places of interest in the area, transportation, etc., I'm going to use the following datasets:

  - Climate Data Online, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/. This one is a dataset provides by the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
  - 50 open datasets, https://www.dropbox.com/s/tpi9q8u88otuc7k/verified50datasets.docx?dl=0. It contains 50 datasets with relevant information from the city of Chicago.


Description of the application

The main idea of the project is make a simple application, which recommends the best place for the student to live according to these two parameters: highest safety and in budget. The application consists of a simple UI and user will be able to navigate between the different housing options that are in Chicago.
  - Map View: For the visualization of the student's location I'm going to use Google Maps, this map will be on the home page and will show the location of the university and its surroundings.

  - Data Visualization: I'm going to use tables and graphs to show the characteristics of each of the housing options that the application throws. The app will have safer, cheaper and closer housing tops so the student can choose their favorite.

  - Interaction Form: The app will have search filters so that the student could find their ideal place, these filters will be shops, restaurants, bars, parks, main roads and more.

  - Ranking of the best houses according to the students: Students will be able to give their rating of the houses that are included in the app and they can also leave comments, this will also be another search filter.

The application will run on the main internet browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer.
