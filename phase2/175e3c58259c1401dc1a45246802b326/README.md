1. App name: "Room Finder"
2. Keywords: optimal, security, price
3. Description of datasets and function design:  
	Affordable Rental Housing Developments [link] [datatype] [data
	columns used] [data amount]
	Police Stations
	Crimes - 2001 to present
	Park District Facilities
	Bike Racks
	Pedestrian Streets

	* Will I use "online clime data" from data.gov?
	* Yes I only use dataset provided in the suggested page of U.S. gov.

4. Brief Description:  
	The principal aim of this project is make easy to foreign people in
	Chicago find the closest room or place to live that it is near to
	Computer Science Department of Chicago's University, not only based
	in the price (as "Trivago" does) but too in other parameters such
	as security, environmental issues, parks near, etc... The
	principal objective behind this, is that the application outputs
	the essential information and do not overflow the user that leads
	in the same problem. The secondary objective is deploy de
	application in a way that can be easily extrapolated to another
	cities around the world.

	UPDATE!!
	A new idea for data visualization... process de entire dataset that have all
	crimes and chicago, to count the number of apareances certain location, so
	that location that is most counted is most insecure. Then do something that
	is done in this page [link] http://www.infocaptor.com/bubble-my-page. After
	that the table of most named location can be marked in map, this can be util
	if desired room of all disponible (we can put all in map) are maked too <- So
	with this idea the other requeriments is satisfaid (budget). The bubble chart
	is keep up!
	A zoomable treemap is a good idea too: [link] http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/treemap.html
	


	* Map View:  
		1. No, the map when is displayed has as center the Computer
		Science Departament.
		2. No, for the development of application (and its easiness)
		I do not consider the markets location.
		3. No, as I do not use markets, I do not need of market
		labels.
		4. No, the same as above.
		5. Yes, possible red blurred circle areas covering the
		security critical areas.

	* Data Visualization:  
		1. Yes, a bubble chart with colors will be used. The colors
		intend to indicate to user in the way that the most
		predominant is a color, then a specific feature of the room is
		acommplished, e.g. most red than blue points to a insecure
		site than another that contains more blue than red.  

		2. Yes, the unique is select in map a location. Also, there
		will be a button that selects the next closest location to the
		Computer Science Dept in map.
		Summary:  
			- Select signalized location in map.
			- Button that selects the next closest location

	* Interaction Form:    
		1. Yes, the output is a Bubble Chart
		2.
