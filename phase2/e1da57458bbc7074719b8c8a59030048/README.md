#### Description of the solution:

Provide real-time data about the conditions of the places that are available for rent, taking into account the cost of living in that area / neighborhood, the security score, calculated based on the number of crimes per 1000 inhabitants, and the distance and travel time from there to the Department of Computer Science in the University of Illinois.

To do this, three different types of maps will be displayed:
1. **The price map**, which shows, by color tones, the most expensive areas of the city, where the darkest is the most expensive and the clearest is the most affordable.
2. **The security map**, very similar to the price, with color tones indicating the neighborhoods or areas safer and more dangerous. In addition, when zoomed in, it will show specific cases of crimes reported in the place being analyzed.
3. Finally, the **distance map**, which will show circles of different radios with center in the Department of Computer Science, to make it easier to identify the proximity or remoteness of the apartments offered, with respect to the location of the university.
In all maps will be marked the places available for rent, so that the user can identify the areas that he is interested in analyzing.

In addition, graphs will be shown in the "Place information" box with numerical data of the three aspects previously described (which will be the most relevant when analyzing the places), to facilitate the decision of the student who does not have knowledge about the city.
