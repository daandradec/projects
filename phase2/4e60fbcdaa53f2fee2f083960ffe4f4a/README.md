# Ironhacks Project
Author: Kevin Castro (keacastroga@unal.edu.co)
In this project I will develop an application that will help students find an affordable and secure place to rent near the Department of Computer Science - University of Illinois, Chicago.
## Second Iteration
I have expanded the application so that it shows the info of the rental place that gets selected, I was working on adding a bar graph using d3.js but I couldn't figure out how to make the axes work, the idea is to map the values into a 0-5 range.
