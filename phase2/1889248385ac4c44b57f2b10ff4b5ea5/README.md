# Finding best rental option

Keywords: Chicago, rental, options, price, transportation

the main purpose of my mashup and the data sets I will be using during the IronHacks, I will use mainly 10 data sets listed as follows:

*[Speed camera locations.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/speed-camera-locations-0ab34)
*[Crimes - 2001 to present.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-2001-to-present-398a4)
*[Chicago Public Schools - School Locations SY1617.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chicago-public-schools-school-locations-sy1617)
*[Libraries - Locations, Hours and Contact Information.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/libraries-locations-hours-and-contact-information-f3c61)
*[Parks - Locations.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/parks-locations-10f58)
*[Parks - Facilities & Features.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/parks-facilities-features-c4402)
*[Public Technology Resources.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/public-technology-resources-134a0)
*[Police Stations.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/police-stations-3a3a8)
*[Average Daily Traffic Counts.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/average-daily-traffic-counts-3968f)
*[Affordable Rental Housing Developments.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/affordable-rental-housing-developments-ef5c2)

Initially, the application will ask to the user the amount of money he or she is able to pay for rent and if he or she wants, it will ask for special insterests around the place. After that, the application will show him a few options with markers in the map. He will be able to click every marker and that will show him important facts of that place, but also, a general presentation of that place based on security, free time activities, transportation and some other facts. 

The data sets I listed are the ones that I have found so far, my goal is to find some other related to cultural or enjoyable experiencies but also about stores and vital needs. Probably I wont use all of the data sets but I want to have a reference for every idea that can appear during the programming sessions.

For the second phase I used bootstrap to make it prettier and I charged the informacion from the dataset that includes rental places around the university, also I changed the icon that shows the university for the official logo. IÂ´m trying to get information from Zillow to show rental prices but it has been difficult.
