# Welcome come to my Mashup!

Okay so, my name is Felipe Moreno.

For this time i modified the appearance of the mashup, added some bootstrap for a grid and fixed some issues that my old css gave.

I also got my google console key and finally got the map, also got my own key for the climate set and added a script that uses it.

The button in the form still doesnt work, and i haven't figured out the best way to switch in place my form so i can add what i want there, or simply remove it.
