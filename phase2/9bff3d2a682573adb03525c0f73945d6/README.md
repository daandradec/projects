The idea is to unite several components, in order to give the best information to the user who needs it. This information will take into account the climate, the means of transport that is regularly used, the importance that the user gives to nearby entertainment venues, among others.

[No implemented yet] Labels: Police, hospital,cinema, theater, dance, library.
[No implemented yet] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market
