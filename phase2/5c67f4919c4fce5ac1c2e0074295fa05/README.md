# Welcome come to Ironhacks!

This is the starting point of my app, thinking about the best solution for looking for an accommodation for a student of the university of Illinois. I hope you can find it productive!

## Improvements:

Now you can visualize a new page exclusibily for looking special features of every acomodation. Idealy you can select one specific rent place, and find all especifications in the map ( parks, crime rates, shops, etc...) so, the user will be able to make a better choise . 


### Important
It seems it has been a misunderstanding in the first phase, I submitted one html document just for trying using git and making sure everything was working right, but it was not my project, just a test. Hours later, but before the deadline, I submitted my real project. 
But, because I didn't made any specification, the judge checked the wrong project (the test) so It looked like I didn't do my job, but actually I did it.
I would appreciate if you could do something, otherwise I will be more careful about my submissions , anyway, thanks for your attention.
