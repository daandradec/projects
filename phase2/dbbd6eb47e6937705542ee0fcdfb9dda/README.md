Application Name: GetVeggies

Keywords : farm produce, freshness, price, transportation convenience

Data Sets Used: NOAA climate data, USDA AMS farmers market directory

Brief Intro: As a consumer I need answers to the following questions:
  1. Where do i get farm produce in Lafayette arae ? <- Location (includes List of vendors)
  2. What do i get there ?  What are Common items and seasonal items sold at that location?  <- Type of produce 
  3. Time in which the produce bought from a location gets wasted <- quality of produce sold at that point
  4. Can i just get any veggies (irrespective of price/quality) right now ? <- Availablity  at that location  (i.e. is it 24x7? etc)

GetVeggies will try to address the above basic questions. Further for each consumer query , the app will provide following attributes in a balanced way: Price Vs Quality( on freshness scale) Vs Location-Convenience 

Functionality : 
  Search query: Veggie 
  Search result: Price of veggie, Name of vendor (freshness scale number indicated on the side . also that number is coloured in least-quality-red--> yellow --->top-quality-green), Location /distance to that place from current location
