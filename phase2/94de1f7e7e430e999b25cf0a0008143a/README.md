# Road Trip Agent
In this project, I plan to develop an intelligent road trip planner by reactive programming, which can produce a road trip plan based on userâ€™s travelling date, weather of different arease, and information of scenic areas in database. This application will provide a carefully considered solution to users and inspire them, while users do not have to input the destination place.

- How to use it:
1.	Install Visual Studio 2015 or higher version
2.	Open the RoadTripAgent.sln and load the whole project by Visual Studio
3.	View the project in browser (CTRL+SHIFT+W)
