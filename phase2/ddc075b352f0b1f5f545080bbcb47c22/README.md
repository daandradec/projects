Basically my application shows information about the weather in chicago and the location of the University of Illinois, Chicago on the map with a tag representing its location.
Does not have any interaction between application and user
The weather is obtained through the API of http://api.openweathermap.org and the map is obtained from the google maps API.
In next versions I want to create the radar to obtain the most optimal places of income for the students and to implement more datasets to complement the application.
