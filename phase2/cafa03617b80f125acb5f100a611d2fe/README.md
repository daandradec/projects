# Where to Live

Keywords: rent, apartment, options

Description: This project is about finding an apartment to rent near the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois, which will take into account the features that the user wants for their choice. A banner is provided where the user will make the choices of the presented options and look for the apartment with the specified characteristics, the banner will be hidden and in the right part of the page will appear a new banner that will have in order the specifications of the apartments available together With the photo of the same and will indicate the location of these on the map. This is the way I plan to make the page although I'm still not sure if this is the best way to do it and I present a very primitive page of the project.
